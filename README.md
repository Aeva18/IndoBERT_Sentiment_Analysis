As social media significantly shapes societal norms and ethical paradigms, understanding real-time public sentiment provides valuable insights for political parties to evaluate their candidates, key issues, and campaign strategies. Leveraging the high-performance and language specificity of LLM models, namely indoBERT, this study aims to contribute to the refinement of deep learning models to gauge public opinion on the 2024 presidential election in Indonesia through the analysis of Twitter data. The paper concluded that indoBERT model achieved an accuracy of 84.7%, precision of 84.3%, recall of 84.7% and F1-score of 84.5%. In conclusion, the findings of this study lay the groundwork for more extensive analyses, enriching our comprehension of the intricate dynamics of public opinion in the political sphere. As we look to the future, the integration of cutting-edge language models like IndoBERT with real-time social media data emerges as a transformative force in reshaping political analysis.
